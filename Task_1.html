    <h3>Early life and education</h3>
    <hr width="100%" size="2">
    <p>Gere was born in Philadelphia on August 31, 1949,[4] the eldest son and second child of homemaker Doris Ann (née
        Tiffany; 1924–2016) and NMIC insurance agent Homer George Gere (1922–2023).[5][6] His father originally intended
        to become a minister.[7] Gere was raised Methodist[8][9] in Syracuse, New York.[10] His paternal
        great-grandfather, George Lane Gere (1848–1932), changed the spelling of his surname from "Geer". One of his
        ancestors, also named George, was an Englishman who came from Heavitree, England, and settled in the Connecticut
        Colony in 1638.[11] Both of Gere's parents were Mayflower descendants; his ancestors include Pilgrims such as
        John Billington, William Brewster, Francis Eaton, Francis Cooke, Degory Priest, George Soule and Richard
        Warren.[12]</p>
    <p>In 1967, Gere graduated from North Syracuse Central High School, where he excelled at gymnastics and music and
        played the trumpet.[7] Gere attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst on a gymnastics scholarship,
        studying philosophy; after two years, he left and did not graduate.[7][13]</p>

    <h3>Career</h3>
    <hr width="100%" size="2">
    <p>Gere first worked professionally at the Seattle Repertory Theatre and the Provincetown Playhouse on Cape Cod in
        1969, where he starred in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. His first major acting role was in the 1971
        rock opera Soon, written by Scott Fagan and Joe Kookoolis, which opened on Broadway at the Ritz Theatre and
        closed after three performances.[14][15] Following that, he appeared in the original London stage version of
        Grease, in 1973.[7] Gere was one of the first notable Hollywood actors to play a homosexual character, starring
        as a gay Holocaust victim in the 1979 Broadway production of Bent, for which he earned a Theatre World Award.

    <p>Gere began appearing in Hollywood films in the mid-1970s. Originally cast in a starring role in The Lords of
        Flatbush (1974), he was replaced after fighting with his co-star Sylvester Stallone. Gere played a small but
        significant part in Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) and starred in director Terrence Malick's well-reviewed drama
        Days of Heaven (1978).[7] The crime drama American Gigolo (1980) significantly boosted his profile and the
        romantic drama An Officer and a Gentleman (1982) (co-starring Debra Winger) cemented Gere's ascent to stardom,
        grossing almost $130 million[16] and winning two Academy Awards out of six nominations;[17] Gere himself
        received his first Golden Globe Award nomination.[18] For the remainder of the 1980s, Gere appeared in films of
        varying critical and commercial reception.[19][20] His career rebounded with the releases of Internal Affairs
        (1990) and Pretty Woman (1990), the latter of which earned Gere his second Golden Globe Award nomination.[21]
        The 1990s saw Gere star in successful films including Sommersby (1993) (opposite Jodie Foster), Primal Fear
        (1996) and Runaway Bride (1999) (which reunited him with his Pretty Woman co-star Julia Roberts).[19] He also
        took a leading role in the action thriller The Jackal (1997), playing former IRA militant Declan Mulqueen; Gere
        affected an Irish accent for the role.[22]</p>
    <p>Gere was named People magazine's "Sexiest Man Alive" in 1999. Not long thereafter, all in the same year, he
        appeared in the hit films The Mothman Prophecies (2002), Unfaithful (2002), and the Academy Award-winning
        musical film adaptation Chicago (2002),[7] for which Gere won his first Golden Globe Award. His ballroom dancing
        drama Shall We Dance? (2004) was also a solid performer that grossed $170 million worldwide.[23] His next film,
        the book-to-screen adaptation Bee Season (2005), was a commercial failure.[24] Gere went on to co-star with
        Jesse Eisenberg and Terrence Howard in The Hunting Party (2007), a thriller in which he played a journalist in
        Bosnia. He next appeared with Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and Cate Blanchett in Todd Haynes' semi-biographical
        film about Bob Dylan, I'm Not There (2007); Gere was one of six actors to portray a variation of Dylan. He
        co-starred with Diane Lane in the romantic drama Nights in Rodanthe (2008). The film was widely panned by
        critics[25] (making #74 on The Times Worst Films of 2008 list),[26] but grossed over $84 million worldwide.[27]
        The film is his most recent to have been produced entirely by a major film studio.</p>
    <p>Gere has expressed a belief that his politics regarding China, an important financial resource for major
        Hollywood studios, have made him unwelcome within Hollywood.[28] Gere embraced his apparent exile from Hollywood
        and instead appeared in independent films that garnered some of the best reviews of his career.[20] Gere was
        notably singled out for portraying businessman Robert Miller in Arbitrage (2012), earning his fourth Golden
        Globe Award nomination. Among many positive reviews,[29] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone cited Gere's performance
        as "too good to ignore" and "an implosive tour de force".[30] Also in 2012, he received the Golden Starfish
        Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Hamptons International Film Festival and the Career Achievement Award
        from the Hollywood Film Awards.[31][32] Gere had earlier received an award from the 34th Cairo International
        Film Festival in December 2010.[33]</p>
    <p>Gere made a notable departure from his traditional screen persona with Joseph Cedar's political drama Norman
        (2016). The film saw Gere portray Norman Oppenheimer, a small-time Jewish fixer. Gere himself described the
        character as an embodiment of the "sides of us we know are annoying and needy".[34] His portrayal of Oppenheimer
        was called "consistently, completely fascinating" by RogerEbert.com[35] and was singled out as a worthy Academy
        Award contender by Variety.[36]</p>
    <p>Gere is an accomplished musician, composing and performing the Pretty Woman piano theme and a guitar solo in
        Runaway Bride. He studied tap for three months to shoot half a day of dancing for his role as lawyer Billy Flynn
        in Chicago.[37] He also studied karate for An Officer and a Gentleman.[38]</p>
    <p>Multiple film critics and media outlets have cited Gere as one of the best actors never to have received an
        Academy Award nomination.[39][40]</p>
